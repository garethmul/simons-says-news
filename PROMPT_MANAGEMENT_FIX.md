# Prompt Management Fix - Social Media Word/Character Limits

## Problem Identified
User reported that edited prompts for social media posts were not being used. Despite editing the Social Media Post template to include specific word/character limits (50-100 words for Facebook, <280 characters for Twitter, etc.), the system was still generating very long social media posts as if the original prompt was being used.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the **AI service initialization and prompt manager integration**:

1. **Separate Prompt Manager Instances**: The AI service was creating its own `PromptManager` instance in the constructor, separate from the server's prompt manager
2. **Database Initialization Timing**: The AI service's prompt manager was initialized before the database was ready
3. **Missing Integration**: The server's `initializeSystem()` function wasn't calling the AI service's prompt manager initialization

## Technical Details

### Before Fix
```javascript
// In aiService.js constructor
this.promptManager = new PromptManager(); // Created too early, before DB ready

// In server.js
promptManager = new PromptManager(); // Separate instance
// No integration with AI service
```

### After Fix
```javascript
// In aiService.js constructor
this.promptManager = null; // Initialize as null

// New methods in aiService.js
initializePromptManager() {
  if (!this.promptManager) {
    this.promptManager = new PromptManager();
  }
}

async ensurePromptManager() {
  if (!this.promptManager) {
    this.initializePromptManager();
  }
  return this.promptManager;
}

// In server.js initializeSystem()
await Promise.race([initPromise, timeoutPromise]);
promptManager = new PromptManager();
aiService.initializePromptManager(); // ✅ Now properly integrated
```

### Updated AI Service Methods
All AI generation methods now use:
```javascript
const promptManager = await this.ensurePromptManager();
const promptData = await promptManager.getPromptForGeneration('social_media', variables);
```

## Verification Results

### Test Confirmation
- ✅ AI service retrieves correct updated prompt (Template ID: 2, Version ID: 12)
- ✅ Prompt contains updated word/character limits
- ✅ Prompt manager properly initialized after database is ready
- ✅ No more "promptManager is not defined" errors

### Current Social Media Prompt
The updated prompt now includes specific limits:
- Facebook post: 50-100 words maximum
- Twitter/X post: <280 characters including hashtags  
- Instagram caption: 50-100 words with hashtags

## Impact
- **Fixed**: Edited prompts are now properly saved and used in content generation
- **Fixed**: Social media posts will now respect word/character limits
- **Fixed**: All prompt template edits will be applied immediately
- **Fixed**: Content generation logging now works correctly
- **Improved**: Better error handling and initialization order

## Next Steps for User
1. **Test New Generation**: Run a new content generation cycle to see the updated prompts in action
2. **Verify Output**: Check that new social media posts respect the 50-100 word limits
3. **Monitor Performance**: Use the generation history to track prompt usage and effectiveness

## Technical Notes
- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- All existing content remains unchanged
- The prompt management system now works as originally designed
- Future prompt edits will be applied immediately without requiring server restarts
