## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Monitor fixed source**: Ensure Christian Today UK continues working
2. **Replace broken sources**: Find alternative RSS feeds for the 4 non-working sources
3. **Add error handling**: Improve RSS feed error logging and retry logic

### Alternative Sources to Consider
1. **Premier Christian Radio**: Different from Premier Christian News
2. **Christian Institute**: `https://www.christian.org.uk/news/rss`
3. **Crosswalk UK**: Alternative Christian news source
4. **Christian Headlines**: International Christian news
5. **Evangelical Focus**: European evangelical news

### Technical Improvements
1. **User-Agent headers**: Add proper headers to avoid bot blocking
2. **Retry logic**: Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
3. **Health monitoring**: Track source reliability over time
4. **Fallback mechanisms**: Website scraping when RSS fails

## Conclusion
Successfully improved the news aggregation system by fixing 1 out of 4 broken sources. The system now aggregates from 4 reliable Christian news sources instead of 3, providing more comprehensive coverage. The remaining 4 sources require either alternative RSS URLs or replacement with different news sources.

**Next Priority**: Replace the 4 non-working sources with reliable alternatives to achieve 6-8 working sources total.
